The paper that introduced ATL is self-explanatory.

Here are some papers promised in Monday Q & A:

- parameterised model checking of strategic ability
- probabilistic model checking of strategic ability
- techniques to reduce state space (partial order reduction)
- an old paper on abstraction in temporal logic model checking
- a recent paper on abstraction in model checking strategic ability
- strategic ability with (earning and spending) resources

Happy to provide more references, and also you can follow
